## Enable Versioning for S3 Bucket 

Enable Versioning for S3 Bucket allows multiple versions of an object to be stored within the bucket, providing a mechanism to recover from unintended deletions or overwrites. When versioning is enabled, each object uploaded to the bucket is assigned a unique version ID, which helps identify and manage different versions of the same object. This feature is particularly useful for data recovery and compliance, as it maintains a history of changes to objects.

To enable versioning, go to the search bar, type and select ```S3```.
